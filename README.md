# Project 1
Submitted by Ian Livingston, Allen Kim and Bao Nguyen

# Objective

WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) is holding its annual gala in NYC this fall. In response to an RFP from Karrine and Dahlia of WTWY, we will use MTA Turnstile Data to propose an optimal strategy for the street teams WTWY will be positioning at subway station entrances around NYC. With this strategy we hope to help WTWY:

1. Fill the event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology
2. Concurrently build awareness and reach for WTWY
